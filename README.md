#Overview

We are creating a Marketplace for Vanderbilt University. The application will run on two platforms, as a web application and an iOS application. The applications are organized in their respective folders. The applications will share the same backend.

Selling and buying items online has always been difficult, more specifically for the Vanderbilt community. From untrustworthy sellers on Craigslist to unmonitored Facebook groups, there has never been a safe, all-encompassing platform where the Vanderbilt community can buy and sell useful services or items. The VU Marketplace is shaped after the wildly successful Chicago University Marketplace. The VU Marketplace seeks to remedy this issue as the go-to forum for commerce within the Vanderbilt University community.

The VU Marketplace is a web application specific to the Vanderbilt community to buy and sell products or services. Example of items that may be listed on the VU Marketplace could be students or faculty selling clothing, sportswear, technology, textbooks, refrigerators, transportation (seat in a car for Spring/Fall/Summer break travels), tutoring services, babysitting services, and more. Due to the fact that the VU Marketplace is only available to the Vanderbilt community allows for safer transactions, premier access to items that students and faculty are selling for cheap, and more trustworthy sellers and buyers.The web application will include several tabs listing the categories of products, including books, electronics, furniture, clothing, services, appliances, subleases, and “wanted”. The “wanted” section will allow users to post desired items or services. Users would receive notifications of new listings that match their “wanted” listings.
