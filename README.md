# mealplanserverapp

##TODO:
* Add a database of books, be able to search on those books and add listings under those categories

* A listing is a template for transactions, transactions are created from listings, every listing can have multiple transactions requests created from it, of which the seller selects to accept.

* When making a new transaction (request), add its id to the transaction_ids of the listing its being made from

* When a transaction_request is declined, remove the transaction from the listing_ids 

###Transaction
* _id
* listing_id
* creation_time
* buyer_user_id
* seller_user_id
* conversation
* buyer_accepted_request (default true)
* seller_accepted_request (default null)
* end_time
* start_time
* active (default true)

* transactions have foreign keys to listing_id but listing_id doesn't have foreign key to transaction_id, in order to preserve the atomicity property of tables.
* when creating transactions, check if listing is active to know if a transaction request can be made on the listing


###Listing
* _id
* book_id
* description
* price
* location
* creation_time
* book_id 

##COMPLETED:
* ~~add ability to upload profile picture~~
* ~~add limit on number of transactions per user to 3 and the number of listings to 8~~
* ~~1 minute countdown timer for accepting a transaction request~~
